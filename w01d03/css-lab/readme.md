#CSS Basics Lab

###Introduction

Your task is to take the starter code provided, and add CSS styles to recreate the screenshot below. Some of the CSS has been done for you, and there are 10 tasks for you to complete in order to reach the finished site.

A Reset CSS file has been included for you, as well as a link to a Google Font. Have a read through the CSS that is already in the `style.css` file. The styles have been arranged into sections, so get familiar with where things are.

###Instructions

Working in pairs, and using Google to help you, complete the following steps:

1. Make the `<main>` horizontally centered on the page using the margin property.
2. Use floats to make the `<section>` and the `<aside>` sit next to each other like they do in the screenshot.
3. Give the `<nav>` a grey (`#ddd`) border on the top and bottom.
4. Make the `<li>`s in the header bold.
5. Make the last `<li>` in the header float to the right (have a look at the CSS selector [:last-child](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_last-child.asp)).
6. Make the `<a>` inside the last `<li>` in the header red (`#D10B0C`).
7. Give the `<h2>` tags inside the articles a font size of 24px.
8. Make the text in the red box centered.
9. Make the `<li>`s in the footer uppercase.
10. Make the image in the footer 180px wide.
11. Add styles to the images inside the smaller articles to make them look like the screenshot (image sitting next to the text).
12. Add styles to the list of categories to make them look like the screenshot.
13. Give them [hover](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) styles so that they look like the screenshot below:

14. Add a hover style to the `<a>` tags inside the `<h2>` tags inside each article so that they go red (#D10B0C) when hovered over.
15. Add styles to the "Next" link to make it look like the screenshot.

**Important:** Remember to use the Chrome dev tools to inspect the elements in the DOM, to check whether or not your styles are being applied, or if they are being overwritten by a style with a higher specificity.

###Bonus

* Add CSS [transitions](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) to the header and article links with hover states so that the color changes gradually over 0.2 seconds.
