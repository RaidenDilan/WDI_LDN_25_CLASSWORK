## Tic Tac Toe

### Introduction

Your task for today is to code the classic Tic Tac Toe game in pairs. You will have most of the day to do it, so take your time and pseudocode the game logic together first. 

### Requirements

* A user should be able to click on a square to make their move
* Every click will alternate between marking an X and O
* Upon marking of an individual cell, use JavaScript to add a class to each square to display separate colors
* A square should not be able to be replayed once marked
* Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board

### Bonus 

* Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played
* After the necessary moves have been played, stop the game and display the winner if one player ends up winning with three in a row
* **Hint:** Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those combinations on the board contents after every move

### Extra Bonus
* Create the board using JavaScipt rather than adding it in your `index.html` 
* Add sounds, animations or images
