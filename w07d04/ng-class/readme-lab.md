# `ngClass` Lab

Add radio buttons to the donut form to decide whether you would recommend the donut or not.

- If you chose 'yes' the donut should have a border of `2px dotted green`.
- If you chose 'no' the donut should have a border of `2px dashed red`.

Look at the [documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/input/input%5Bradio%5D) for using radio buttons with Angular and `ngModel`.
