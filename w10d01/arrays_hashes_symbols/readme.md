Calculate stops between stations on subway lines.

Take the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints the total number of stops for the trip.

- There are 3 subway lines:

  1. The N line has the following stops: 
    Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th

  2. The L line has the following stops: 
    8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st 
    
  3. The 6 line has the following stops: 
    Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.

All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points. (For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th stop on the 6 line.)
